Embed your Pollcaster.com polls on your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Embed your [Pollcaster](http://www.pollcaster.com) polls on your WordPress site. Allows the use of a special short code `[pollcaster]` for embedding Pollcaster polls.

[Pollcaster](http://www.pollcaster.com) + Pollcaster Shortcode Plugin = **WordPress lovin’.**

[Pollcaster](http://www.pollcaster.com) is the world’s most engaging poll tool. It lets everyone from Fortune 500 companies to bloggers to create a poll and share it with the world. Now with our WordPress plugin, anyone using WordPress can create and embed polls. This means you can add polls to your site or blog, and your visitors won’t need to leave your site to take them.

You could embed polls on WordPress before, but the process was more complicated and didn’t work for everyone. We’ve simplified things and created the **Pollcaster Shortcode Plugin**. With it, you create a poll on Pollcaster and grab the WordPress shortcode. Then, with the plugin installed on your site, you can paste that shortcode into any post or page. That’s it! Your poll will appear on your site. Your poll will appear inline with your content, just like when you embed a video from YouTube or Vimeo.

Don't have a Pollcaster account? No problem. Head over to [Pollcaster.com](http://www.pollcaster.com) and sign up for a free account, and start making your own polls.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Pollcaster? =

[Pollcaster](http://www.pollcaster.com) is a web app that makes it possible for anyone to build beautiful, engaging polls. It's the perfect way to share rich, immersive polls with your audience. [Learn more about Pollcaster](http://www.pollcaster.com).

= Why is this plugin useful? =

Shortcodes are cleaner and simpler. This plugin allows Authors to embed a poll on a WordPress page or post, whereas only Editors and Admins can copy and paste javascript embed codes.
A quick tip: with embed codes, you need to make sure to be in the "Text" tab of the writing area. If you are in the "Visual" tab, the embed code will not work. Short codes work in either text editor.

= But wait! I already have a poll using the old embed code! Will it still work on WordPress? =

Your poll will continue to function and look good doing it. Heck, if you want to keep using the old method for future polls, that’s fine. We just created the shortcode, because it’s cleaner and simpler.

= Is it difficult to install and get setup? =

Nope, it’s easy. Check out the Installation section for the details.

= What do all the parameters in the code mean? =
* id: the unique id of your poll on our system.
* width: the pixel or percentage width of your poll container. ("500px" or "100%" - Default: "100%")
* height: the pixel or percentage width of your poll container. ("500px", "100%", "auto" - Default: "auto")

If that was over your head, don’t worry. Just install the plugin, copy the shortcode from Pollcaster after creating the poll, and paste it into WordPress. Your poll will look great.
