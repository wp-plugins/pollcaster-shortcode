Embed your Pollcaster.com polls on your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Embed your [Pollcaster](http://www.pollcaster.com) polls on your WordPress site. Allows the use of a special short code `[pollcaster]` for embedding Pollcaster polls.

[Pollcaster](http://www.pollcaster.com) + Pollcaster Shortcode Plugin = **WordPress lovin’.**

[Pollcaster](http://www.pollcaster.com) is the world’s simplest poll tool. It lets everyone from Fortune 500 companies to your mother create a poll and share it with the world. Now with our WordPress plugin, anyone who creates their own content on WordPress can now create and embed their own polls. That means you can use our poll tool to promote your own site or blog without people ever leaving your site.

You could embed polls on WordPress before, but the process was complicated and didn’t work for all types of users on WordPress. We wanted to simplify the process, so we created the **Pollcaster Shortcode Plugin** and made it available for all our faithful WordPress users. You create a poll on Pollcaster, grab the WordPress shortcode and with the plugin installed on your WordPress site, just paste it into any post or page on WordPress and that’s it. Your poll will embed itself on your site and like embedding a video from YouTube or Vimeo, your poll will appear inline with your content.

Don't have a Pollcaster account? No problem! Head over to [Pollcaster.com](http://www.pollcaster.com) and sign up for a free account, and start making your own polls.

= Current Features =

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Pollcaster? =

[Pollcaster](http://www.pollcaster.com) is a web app that helps anybody build beautiful engaging polls. It's great for sharing rich, immersive polls with your audience. [Learn more about Pollcaster](http://www.pollcaster.com).


= Why is this plugin useful? =

Shortcodes are cleaner and simpler! Only Editors and Admins can copy and paste the javascript embed code to embed a Pollcaster poll onto a WordPress page, authors cannot.

With embed codes you need to make sure to be in the "Text" tab of the writing area. If a user is in the "Visual" (default) tab, the embed code will not work. Short codes will always work in either text editor.

= But wait! I already have a poll using the old embed code! Will it still work on WordPress? =

Fear no more! Your poll will continue to function with no problem. Heck, if you want to keep using the old method for future polls, that’s fine. We just created the shortcode, like was said before, because it’s cleaner and simpler.


= Is it difficult to install and get setup? =

Nope, it’s so easy! Check out the Installation section to see just how easy it is.

= What do all the parameters in the code mean? =

* id: The id of your poll. (Valid values are your poll id "123")
* width: The pixel or percentage width of your poll container. ("500px" or "100%" - Default: "100%")
* height: The pixel or percentage width of your poll container. ("500px", "100%", "auto" - Default: "auto")

Now if that was over your head, no need to worry about it. Just install the plugin, copy the shortcode from Pollcaster after creating the poll and paste it into WordPress and your poll will look great!
